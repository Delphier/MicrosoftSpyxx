# Microsoft Spy++ (spyxx.exe)
**Extracted from latest Visual Studio.**

Spy++ (SPYXX.EXE) is a Win32-based utility that gives you a graphical view of the system's processes, threads, windows, and window messages. Spy++ lets you perform the following tasks:
- Display a graphical tree of relationships among system objects. These include the Processes view, Threads view, and Windows view.
- Search for specified windows, threads, processes, or messages.
- View the properties of selected windows, threads, processes, or messages.
- Select a window, thread, process, or message directly in the view.
- Use the Finder Tool to select a window by mouse pointer positioning.
- Set message option by using complex message log selection parameters.

## Usage

There are two versions of Spy++. The first version, named Spy++ (spyxx.exe), is designed to display messages sent to a window that is running in a 32-bit process.

The second version, named Spy++ (64-bit) (spyxx_amd64.exe), is designed to display messages sent to a window that is running in a 64-bit process. Although the Spy++ (64-bit) file name contains amd, it runs on any x64 Windows operating system.
